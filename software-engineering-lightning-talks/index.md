# Software Engineering Lightning Talks

Draft - Work In Progress - Request For Collaboration

## Introduction

NHS Wales has many software engineers, and many good ideas. We want to create a
get-together where our teammates can do lightning talks to showcase ideas. 

This is a bit like a TED Talk event, with the talks being focused on software
engineering, including practices, tooling, source code, learning and growth
paths, and the like.

For more please contact Joel Henderson (<joel.henderson@wales.nhs.uk>).

## Invitation

Who: DHCW software engineers and related employees.

What: Twelve fast talks to inspire our technical teams.

Where: TÅ· Glan-yr-Afon, 21 Cowbridge Road, East Cardiff, CF11 9AD, Cymru.

When: July 2. 9:00 a.m. - 12:30 p.m. talks, then 12:30 pizza lunch.

Why: Soft launch our new ways of working using our new conference area.

Capacity: 50 people (TBD). RSVP please.

## Soft launch

We intend this to be a "soft launch" of our new conference area, and of our new
ways of working. In other words, this is more like a first experiment with
hosting this kind of event, and is less like a fully-professional fully-perfect
conference.

## Themes

These are work in progress.

Broadly we want the themes to go in order from user-facing orientation to implementation-facing orientation.

**UX: User experience for software engineering:**

* Example ideas for from-scratch: how to engineer UI/UX designs by using HTML,
CSS, JavaScript, TypeScript, etc.

* Example ideas for tooling: as well as with design tools such as Figma and
Canvas that can code-generate, and with sharable design systems such as GOV.UK
and NHS-X, and sharable component systems such as DaisyUI and Tailwind.

**QA: Quality assurance for software engineering:**

* Example ideas for testing: how to do unit tests, functional tests, integration
tests, benchmark tests, fuzz tests, mutation tests, test-driven development,
system quality attributes, etc.

* Example ideas for CI/CD/CT: how to do continuous integration, continuous
  delivery, continuous telemetry.

**DX: Developer experience for software engineering:**

* Example ideas for testing: how to do unit tests, functional tests, integration tests,
  benchmark tests, fuzz tests, mutation tests, test-driven development, etc.

* Example ideas for CI/CD/CT: how to do continuous integration, continuous
  delivery, continuous telemetry, DORA metrics.

* Example ideas for tooling; git, containers, virtual environments, Windows
  Subsystem for Linux, devops, secops.

* Example ideas for topics: ways of working, make the work visible, upskilling
  opportunities, strong core with many postures.

**AI: Artificial Intelligence for software engineering:**

* Example ideas for creating software: how software engineers can use AI to
improve software design, development, testing, deployment, telemetry, and the
like.

* Example idea for upskilling: how to leverage AI for learning new skills,
  such as new programming languages, new software programming paradigms, new
  tooling, etc.

## Talks

We want each talk to be 6 minutes, then a few minutes for questions, for a maximum 9 minutes total.

We want each presenter to have a few teammates in the crowd who are prepared with a few suitable questions, just in case no one else asks anything. In other words, we specifically want to seed questions, because this encourages more people to talk more.

The next presenter starts immediately at the 10 minute mark because we want to keep things fast and on track.

## Six Slide Ideas

If you're a presenter and you're seeking slide ideas, here are [six slide
ideas](six-slide-ideas/). You can even time your presentation to one minute per
slide, which makes it easy to stay on track.

## Date & Time

Tenative date: Wednesday July 2, 09:00 to 13:30.

We believe this is the first avialable date when our new big presentation room is likely to be ready.

Day:

* We are choosing a Wednesday because more of our teammates are in the office.

* We considered a Friday because more of our teammates have more-relaxed
  schedules. However, many of the teammates are working from home on a Friday,
  or on vacation on a Friday.

Time:

* We are considering 9 a.m. to noon for talks, then an hour for pizza lunch because we want attendees to meet and greet, and discuss the ideas.

## Rooms

We are requesting the largest conference room on the ground floor. We're requesting time from 08:00 (setup) to 14:00 (cleanup).

We are also requesting the two medium-sized conference rooms on the ground for lunch setup. We're requesting time from 11:00 (setup) to 14:00 (cleanup).

We are also requesting the main open area for lunch seating from 12:00 (no setup needed) to 14:00 (cleanup).

## Corp services

We are in touch with corporate services.

The title of the event is "Software Engineering Lightning Talks".

The contact person for the event is Joel Henderson (<joel.henderson@wales.nhs.uk>).

## Attendees

For this soft launch, we're able to invite employees but not external people. We
do intend to hold a similar future event that's open to external people, such as
our service providerfs, our peers at other organizations, our software
stakeholders, etc.
